I can reproduce the latency spikes, but they don't correlate with database load, CPU usage, or memory pressure on the Nightingale service itself.

        "answer": "The latest performance issue in Project Nightingale was caused by a **race condition in an upstream dependency, the `Token-Refresher` service**. This occurred when multiple pods attempted to refresh the same expired public key set simultaneously, leading to a lock and blocking all authentication validation calls, which in turn caused slowdowns and timeouts on the Nightingale dashboard.\n\nThe issue was fixed by **Priya Sharma**.\n\nPriya Sharma solved the issue by implementing a permanent fix using a **Redis-based distributed lock** to prevent the race condition in the `Token-Refresher` service. This ensures that only one process can refresh the public keys at any given time. The fix was merged and deployed to production, resolving the latency issues.\n\nThe exact code snippet implemented to solve the issue is:\n```python\n# Implements a distributed lock for the token refresh process to prevent race conditions.\n# This resolves the intermittent latency issues observed in downstream services like Nightingale.\nimport redis\nimport time\n\nREDIS_CLIENT = redis.Redis(host='redis.internal', port=6379, db=0)\nLOCK_KEY = 'token-refresh-lock'\nLOCK_TIMEOUT = 60 # 60 seconds\n\ndef refresh_public_keys():\n    # Try to acquire a lock\n    is_locked = REDIS_CLIENT.set(LOCK_KEY, 'true', nx=True, ex=LOCK_TIMEOUT)\n    if not is_locked:\n        print('Could not acquire lock, another process is refreshing keys.')\n        return\n\n    try:\n        print('Lock acquired.
